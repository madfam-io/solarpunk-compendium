We're building something new.

The Solarpunk Almanac is practical wisdom for regenerative living — a living ecosystem that helps people and communities build futures worth wanting.

What we're creating:

📅 SEASONAL EDITIONS
Quarterly guides aligned with solstices and equinoxes. Practical knowledge for each season — from food preservation to energy efficiency, community organizing to ecological restoration.

🌍 GLOBAL DIRECTORY
A searchable database of solarpunk projects, ecovillages, community gardens, makerspaces, and organizations worldwide. Find your people.

🛠️ PRACTICAL TOOLS
Calculators, templates, guides, and checklists. Not just theory — actual tools you can use today.

🤝 COMMUNITY NETWORK
Local chapters building regenerative futures together. Events, skill-shares, and mutual support.

This is open infrastructure. Knowledge that could help build better futures shouldn't be locked behind paywalls.

# Announcing The Solarpunk Almanac

What would it look like to create practical infrastructure for the solarpunk movement?

Not just fiction or aesthetics — though those matter — but actual tools, guides, directories, and community structures that help people build regenerative futures in their own communities?

That's what we're building.

## The Vision

The Solarpunk Almanac aims to become open infrastructure for the global solarpunk movement: an educational hub, coordination layer, and resource commons that helps millions learn, connect, and act.

We inherit a lineage of practical wisdom publications:
- The Farmer's Almanac (1818–present)
- Poor Richard's Almanack (Benjamin Franklin)
- The Whole Earth Catalog (Stewart Brand)
- The Foxfire Books

And we extend this tradition into a solarpunk future — aligned with natural rhythms, powered by community contribution, and freely accessible to all.

## What We're Building

**Seasonal Editions**
Quarterly guides released at solstices and equinoxes. Each edition contains practical knowledge for the season ahead: growing guides, preservation techniques, energy efficiency tips, community organizing strategies, and more.

**Global Directory**
A searchable database of solarpunk-aligned projects worldwide. Find ecovillages, community gardens, makerspaces, repair cafes, tool libraries, and organizations near you — or discover inspiring projects across the globe.

**Practical Tools**
Not just articles, but actual tools: carbon footprint calculators, seed starting planners, solar sizing guides, community asset mapping templates, and more. Knowledge made actionable.

**Community Network**
Local chapters building regenerative futures together. A framework for starting and sustaining solarpunk communities wherever you are.

## Our Values

We believe in:
- **Pragmatic optimism** — Hope as strategy, not naivety
- **Ecological harmony** — Humans as part of nature, not separate
- **Radical inclusivity** — Futures built by and for everyone
- **Community sovereignty** — Tools, not top-down solutions
- **Open knowledge** — Strengthening the commons

## Join Us

We're just getting started. The first Seasonal Edition is in development for the upcoming solstice.

Sign up at almanac.solar to:
- Get early access to content
- Help shape what we build
- Connect with fellow regenerators

This is a community project. We need writers, designers, developers, translators, community organizers, and everyone in between.

Let's build futures worth wanting — together.
