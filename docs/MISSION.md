# The Solarpunk Almanac
## Mission, Vision & Values

---

## Vision

To become the definitive open infrastructure for the global solarpunk movement — an educational hub, coordination layer, and resource commons that helps millions of people learn, connect, and build regenerative futures in their communities.

---

## Mission

The Solarpunk Almanac provides practical wisdom, tools, and community connections that empower individuals and organizations to create sustainable, equitable, and flourishing futures — one season, one project, one community at a time.

## Tagline

**"Practical wisdom for regenerative living"**

## Core Values

### 1. Pragmatic Optimism
We choose hope as a strategy, not naivety. We focus on what's working, what's possible, and what we can build — while remaining clear-eyed about the challenges we face.

### 2. Ecological Harmony
We recognize that human society is embedded in nature, not separate from it. All our work seeks to regenerate rather than extract, to heal rather than harm.

### 3. Radical Inclusivity
We center diverse voices, especially those from communities most impacted by climate change and historical injustice. Solarpunk futures must be built by and for everyone.

### 4. Community Sovereignty
We believe in distributed power, local autonomy, and the wisdom of communities to solve their own problems. We provide tools and connections, not top-down solutions.

### 5. Appropriate Technology
We embrace technology as a tool for liberation, not domination. From high-tech solar panels to low-tech permaculture, we advocate for solutions appropriate to context.

### 6. Open Knowledge
We share freely. Knowledge that could help build better futures should not be locked behind paywalls or proprietary systems. We strengthen the commons.

### 7. Regenerative Economics
We practice what we preach. Our business model generates value that flows back to community and planet, not just to shareholders.

### 8. Prefigurative Practice
We build the future in the present. Every interaction, every process, every decision should embody the world we want to create.

## What We Believe

- **Climate change is real and urgent**, but despair is not the answer. We need visions of flourishing futures to mobilize action.

- **Technology alone won't save us**, but thoughtfully applied appropriate technology is part of the solution.

- **Individual action matters**, but systemic change requires community organizing, policy change, and new economic models.

- **Beauty and aesthetics matter**. A sustainable future should be desirable, not just necessary.

- **Diverse approaches are strength**. There is no single path to a regenerative future — we need a thousand experiments blooming.

- **The future is already here**, it's just not evenly distributed. Our job is to find, document, and spread what's working.

## Our Commitment

We commit to:

1. **Transparency** — Open finances, open governance, open source code where possible.

2. **Accessibility** — Free core content, multilingual support, and inclusive design.

3. **Accountability** — Community governance structures and regular impact reporting.

4. **Sustainability** — Building an organization that can sustain itself without compromising values.

5. **Evolution** — Remaining humble, learning from mistakes, and adapting as we grow.

## The Name: Why "Almanac"?

An almanac is:
- **Cyclical** — Renewed annually, aligned with natural rhythms
- **Practical** — Focused on what to do, not just what to know
- **Democratic** — Accessible wisdom for everyone, not just experts
- **Traditional** — Connected to a lineage of self-sufficiency guides
- **Forward-looking** — Each edition looks to the year ahead

We inherit the tradition of:
- The Farmer's Almanac (1818-present)
- Poor Richard's Almanack (Benjamin Franklin)
- The Whole Earth Catalog (Stewart Brand)
- The Foxfire Books

And we extend it into a solarpunk future.
