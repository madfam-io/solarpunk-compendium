## 1. Executive Summary

### What We're Building

The Solarpunk Almanac is a living ecosystem of knowledge, tools, and community that helps people and organizations build regenerative futures. It transforms the scattered resources of the solarpunk movement into an integrated, accessible, and actionable platform — expressed through:

- **Digital Platform** (web + mobile app)
- **Seasonal Publications** (print + digital)
- **Global Chapter Network**
- **Educational Programs**
- **Movement Infrastructure**

### The Opportunity

Solarpunk is an emergent cultural, aesthetic, and activist movement envisioning sustainable, technologically advanced, and socially just futures. Currently:

- Content is scattered across Reddit, Tumblr, blogs, and academic papers
- No authoritative, beautiful, multilingual hub exists
- The movement lacks infrastructure for coordination and growth
- Organizations seeking solarpunk guidance have no clear entry point

The Solarpunk Almanac fills this gap by becoming **the definitive resource and coordination layer** for the global solarpunk movement.

### Key Numbers (5-Year Target)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Monthly Active Users | 5,000 | 75,000 | 200,000 |
| Paid Members | 200 | 5,000 | 15,000 |
| Print Circulation | 2,000 | 15,000 | 30,000 |
| Active Chapters | 5 | 75 | 150 |
| Annual Revenue | $80K | $570K | $1.52M |

### Investment Required

- **Seed Phase (Year 1):** $100-150K
- **Growth Phase (Years 2-3):** $200-300K additional
- **Sustainability (Year 4+):** Self-funding through earned revenue

---

## 2. Origin Story

### The Seed: Solarpunk Compendium

The initiative began with "The Solarpunk Compendium" — a single-page web application created for Innovaciones MADFAM to present research from a deep-dive document on the solarpunk paradigm.

**Technical Foundation:**
- Self-contained HTML file (~103KB, 789 lines)
- Bilingual content (English/Spanish)
- Three-theme system (Light/Dark/Auto)
- Glassmorphic UI design
- 73 scholarly/community references
- 8 major content sections

**Original Tech Stack:**
- Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Tailwind CSS (CDN)
- Google Fonts (Inter, Orbitron)
- Intersection Observer API
- localStorage for preferences

### The Evolution

Through strategic analysis, the static compendium revealed potential for transformation into something far more significant — a living platform that embodies solarpunk values while serving as practical infrastructure for the movement.

The rebranding from "Compendium" to "Almanac" was pivotal:

| Compendium | Almanac |
|------------|---------|
| Static archive | Living tradition |
| What solarpunk IS | How to LIVE solarpunk |
| Academic reference | Practical guidance |
| One edition | Annual renewal |
| Scholars | Practitioners |

---

## 3. Vision & Mission

### Vision Statement

To become the definitive open infrastructure for the global solarpunk movement — an educational hub, coordination layer, and resource commons that helps millions of people learn, connect, and build regenerative futures in their communities.

### Mission Statement

The Solarpunk Almanac provides practical wisdom, tools, and community connections that empower individuals and organizations to create sustainable, equitable, and flourishing futures — one season, one project, one community at a time.

### Core Values

1. **Pragmatic Optimism** — Grounded hope through actionable solutions
2. **Ecological Harmony** — Reintegration of human society with nature
3. **Radical Inclusivity** — Centering diverse voices and decolonial perspectives
4. **Community Sovereignty** — Distributed power and local autonomy
5. **Appropriate Technology** — Thoughtful application from high-tech to low-tech
6. **Open Knowledge** — Freely shared wisdom that strengthens the commons
7. **Regenerative Economics** — Value flows that strengthen rather than extract
8. **Prefigurative Practice** — Building the future in the present

## 4. The Almanac Positioning

### Why "Almanac"?

The almanac framing connects to a powerful lineage:

| Historical Almanac | Era | Significance |
|-------------------|-----|--------------|
| Farmer's Almanac | 1818-present | Practical wisdom, weather, planting guides |
| Poor Richard's Almanack | 1732-1758 | Wit, wisdom, and utility |
| Whole Earth Catalog | 1968-1972 | "Access to tools" counterculture |
| Foxfire Books | 1972-2004 | Self-sufficiency, traditional skills |
| Permaculture Designer's Manual | 1988 | Ecological design guide |

The Solarpunk Almanac inherits this tradition as the **21st-century guide for regenerative living**.

## 12. Data Engine Architecture

### The Problem

Current state: Content hardcoded in JavaScript objects — a dead end for a living platform.

### The Solution

A data engine that keeps content fresh through:
1. Editorial CMS for curated content
2. Community contribution system
3. Automated aggregation pipelines
4. Health monitoring (link checking, freshness scoring)

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CONTENT SOURCES                          │
